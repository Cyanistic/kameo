## What is Kameo

Kameo is a lightweight Rust library for building fault-tolerant, distributed, and asynchronous actors. It allows seamless communication between actors across nodes, providing [scalability](#use-cases), [backpressure](#feature-highlights), and panic recovery for robust distributed systems.

## Feature Highlights

- **Async Rust**: Each actor runs as a separate Tokio task, making concurrency easy and efficient.
- **Supervision**: Link actors to create a fault-tolerant, self-healing actor hierarchy.
- **Remote Messaging**: Send messages to actors on different nodes seamlessly.
- **Panic Safety**: Panics are gracefully handled, allowing the system to recover and continue running.
- **Backpressure Management**: Supports both bounded and unbounded mpsc messaging for handling load effectively.

## Use Cases

Kameo is versatile and can be applied in various domains, such as:

- **Distributed Microservices**: Build resilient microservices that communicate reliably over a distributed network.
- **Real-Time Systems**: Ideal for building chat systems, multiplayer games, or real-time monitoring dashboards where low-latency communication is essential.
- **IoT Devices**: Deploy lightweight actors on low-resource IoT devices for seamless networked communication.

# Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust installed (check [rustup](https://rustup.rs) for installation instructions)
- A basic understanding of asynchronous programming in Rust

## Installation

Add kameo as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file:

```bash
cargo add kameo
```

## Example: Defining an Actor

```rust
use kameo::Actor;
use kameo::message::{Context, Message};
use kameo::request::MessageSend;

// Define an actor that will keep a count
#[derive(Actor)]
struct Counter {
    count: i64,
}

// Define the message for incrementing the count
struct Inc { amount: i64 }

// Implement how the actor will handle incoming messages
impl Message<Inc> for Counter {
    type Reply = i64;

    async fn handle(&mut self, msg: Inc, _ctx: Context<'_, Self, Self::Reply>) -> Self::Reply {
        self.count += msg.amount;
        self.count
    }
}
```

Spawn and message the actor.

```rust
// Spawn the actor and get a reference to it
let actor_ref = kameo::spawn(Counter { count: 0 });

// Use the actor reference to send a message and receive a reply
let count = actor_ref.ask(Inc { amount: 42 }).send().await?;
assert_eq!(count, 42);
```
